Please analyze the provided food retail shop invoice image and extract the following information. This invoice details a customer's food purchase. Pay close attention to the typical layout and distinguish between printed text and handwritten text.


* **File & Page Handling:**
    * The input may be a single image or a multi-page PDF. If the input is a PDF, you must process every single page.
    * A single page (or image) can contain more than one invoice.
    * You must perform the complete extraction for *each individual invoice* found on *every page*.

* **Invoice Pre-Processing:**
    * **Document Localization:** On each page, identify the boundaries of all invoices. You must focus only on the invoice content and ignore all surrounding clutter or background details.
    * **Image Orientation:** Before extraction, check if an invoice is incorrectly oriented or skewed. It must be straightened (deskewed) to ensure data accuracy.

* **Data Output & Formatting:**
    * **Aggregated Results:** All extracted data from every invoice across all pages must be returned in a single aggregated result (one JSON array). For example, if a 4-page PDF contains a total of 10 invoices, the final output must contain 10 complete invoice records.
    * **Labeling:** Clearly label each piece of extracted data according to the categories specified below.
    * **Text Types:** Distinguish between "Printed Text" and "Handwritten Text" as indicated in the schema.
    * **Completeness:** If a specific field or item is not present on an invoice, you must indicate "Not Found" for that field.
    * **Precision:** Be precise when extracting all numbers, codes, currency, and names.
