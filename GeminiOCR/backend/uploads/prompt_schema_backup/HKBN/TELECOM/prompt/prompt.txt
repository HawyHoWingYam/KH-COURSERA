III. Service & Charge Details (service_details array):
THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART. HKBN has two charge formats. You MUST combine them into this single array.
A. For "HKBN Mobile Services Charges" (usually page 3+):
* These are grouped by phone number. For each group:
* service_number: The 8-digit phone number.
* subtotal: The 'Sub-total' for that phone number.
* charge_items (array): For each line item under this phone number:
   * description: The 'Description of Charges' (e.g., 'HKBN mobile services...').
   * period: The 'Service Period'. Format: YYYY/MM/DD - YYYY/MM/DD.
   * amount: The 'Charge (HK$)' value. Discounts ('Disc') are negative.
B. For "Service Charges / Other Charges" (flat list, often refunds):
* These are individual line items. For EACH line item:
* Create a new object in the service_details array.
* service_number: Parse the 8-digit phone number from the 'Description' string (e.g., from "REFUND - MOBILE#57410267...").
* subtotal: This can be set to null as there's no subtotal for these individual items.
* charge_items (array): Create an array with a single object containing:
   * description: The full 'Description' string (e.g., 'REFUND - MOBILE#...').
   * period: Parse the period from the 'Description' string. Format: YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD.
   * amount: The 'Charge (HK$)' value. Refunds are always negative.
IV. Final Validation Rule:
The sum of all subtotal fields plus the sum of all amount fields from the "Other Charges" section should approximately equal the billing_summary.current_charges.
