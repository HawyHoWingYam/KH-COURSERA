III. Service & Charge Details (service_details array):
CRITICAL: The details are broken down by 'Service Number' across multiple pages. Iterate through each number's section.
For EACH 'Service Number' block:
1. Create a new object in the service_details array and populate it:
   * service_number:
      * The 8-digit number that starts the block.
   * subtotal:
      * The final numeric value at the bottom right of a service number's charge block.
   * charge_items (array):
      * Location: All line items listed under the service number.
      * For EACH line item, extract:
         * period: The date or date range in the first column.
         * description: The English text from the description column (e.g., "Monthly Plan", "Monthly Fee Rebate").
         * amount: The numeric value in the last column. REMINDER: Convert values with "CR" to negative numbers.
IV. Final Validation Rule:
The sum of all subtotal fields from the service_details array should approximately equal the billing_summary.current_charges.
