Please analyze the provided OCS Courier Service Invoice PDF document and extract the information based on the FINAL UNIFIED SCHEMA provided.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST map the extracted data to the provided JSON schema. The key names in your output MUST EXACTLY match the key names defined in the schema (e.g., use "invoice_number", "customer_name", "line_items", etc.).

Overall Document Guidelines:
* provider: Set this value to "OCS".
* __filename: Extract the filename of the PDF document.
* Scope: Extract information from the computer-generated printed text only. Ignore all handwritten notes, signatures, and stamps.

I. Header Section (Top of the page):
1.  invoice_number:
    * Label: 'Invoice No.'.
    * Location: Top right of the document.
    * Value: Extract the alphanumeric string.
2.  invoice_date:
    * Label: 'Date:'.
    * Location: Top right of the document.
    * Value: Extract the date and convert it to YYYY-MM-DD format.
3.  customer_name:
    * Location: In the address block on the upper left.
    * Value: Extract the full company name (e.g., 'HYAKUNOUSHA INT'L LTD').
4.  customer_number:
    * Label: 'Customer No.:'.
    * Location: In the address block on the upper left.
    * Value: Extract the alphanumeric customer identifier.

II. Summary Section (Right side, below the main table):
This section should be mapped to the `summary` object.
1.  total_amount_due:
    * Label: 'Amount Due HK$'.
    * Value: Extract the final numeric value, removing any currency symbols or prefixes.
2.  total_weight_kg:
    * Label: 'Total Weight (Kg)'.
    * Value: Extract the numeric value.
3.  total_items:
    * Label: 'Total no of cwbs'.
    * Value: Extract the integer value representing the total count of waybills.

III. Line Items Section (Main Table):
This is the most critical part. All rows from the main table MUST be extracted into the `line_items` array. For EACH row in the table:
1.  service_date:
    * Column: 'Date'.
    * Value: Extract the date and format it as YYYY-MM-DD.
2.  waybill_number:
    * Column: 'Courier waybill No.'.
    * Value: Extract the waybill number string (e.g., '14-115-212-296'). This is the first piece of information in the second column.
3.  weight_kg:
    * Column: 'Courier waybill No.'.
    * Value: Extract the numeric weight value (e.g., '1.0'). This is the number immediately following the waybill number.
4.  remarks:
    * Column: 'Courier waybill No.'.
    * Value: Extract the descriptive text that follows the weight (e.g., 'HONGKONG ZONE C to D*R').
5.  freight_charge:
    * Column: 'Freight Charge'.
    * Value: Extract the numeric value only. Remove the '$' symbol.
6.  amount:
    * Column: 'Amount'.
    * Value: Extract the numeric value only. Remove the '$' symbol and any trailing non-numeric characters (e.g., for '$85.00m', extract 85.00).

IV. Final Validation Rule:
* The sum of all `amount` values in the `line_items` array should equal the `summary.total_amount_due`.
* The number of objects in the `line_items` array should equal the `summary.total_items`.
