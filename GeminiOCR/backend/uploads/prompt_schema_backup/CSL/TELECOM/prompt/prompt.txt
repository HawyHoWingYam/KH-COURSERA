IV. Service & Charge Details (service_details array):
CRITICAL STRUCTURE INSTRUCTION: The CSL bill has one main mobile number. You MUST create a service_details array containing A SINGLE OBJECT that holds all the charge details for this bill.
1. Create the Single Object in the array and populate it:
   * service_number:
      * Label: 'Mobile No.'.
      * Value: Extract the 8-digit mobile number from the header.
   * subtotal:

      * Value: Use the same value as billing_summary.current_charges.
   * charge_items (array):
      * Location: All line items under the 'Current Charges' section.
      * For EACH line item, extract:
         * description: The English text description (e.g., 'Monthly Mobile Service Fee', 'Monthly Incentive').
         * period: The date range next to the description. Convert to 'YYYY/MM/DD - YYYY/MM/DD' format. If not present, the value should be null.
         * amount: The numeric value on the far right. CRITICAL: Preserve the sign. Positive for charges, negative for incentives (e.g., -480.00).
V. Final Validation Rule:
The sum of all amount fields in the charge_items array should equal the subtotal and billing_summary.current_charges.
