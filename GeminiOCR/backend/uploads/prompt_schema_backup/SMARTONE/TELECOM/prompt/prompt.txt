      * Description (項目內容):
         * Value: Extract the full Chinese description of the charge (e.g., "特選公司月費計劃預繳", "月費回贈", "數據漫遊日費計劃").

* Summation Check: The sum of all the individual phone number subtotals must equal the current_charges_total found on the first page.
* Negative Numbers: The correct handling of "CR" values as negative numbers is essential for accuracy.
V. Required Output Structure
Organize the extracted data into a JSON object. Each phone number should be a distinct object within the phone_bill_details array. Each of those objects will contain an array of its specific charge_items.
