Please analyze the provided SmarTone Statement PDF document and extract the information based on the FINAL UNIFIED SCHEMA provided.
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST map the extracted data to the provided JSON schema. The key names in your output MUST EXACTLY match the key names defined in the schema (e.g., use "invoice_date", "customer_name", "service_number", etc.).
Global Rules:
* Language: Prioritize extracting the Chinese text for charge descriptions ("項目內容").
* Amounts with "CR": Any amount followed by "CR" MUST be converted to a NEGATIVE number. All other amounts are positive.
Overall Document Identification:
* provider: Set this value to "SmarTone".
* __filename: Extract the filename of the PDF document.
I. Page 1 - Header & Account Summary:
1. customer_name:
   * Location: Top-left corner of the first page.
   * Value: Extract the full company name (e.g., "HYAKUNOUSHA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED").
2. account_number:
   * Label: '賬戶號碼'.
   * Value: Extract the 8-digit number that follows.
3. invoice_date:
   * Label: '發單日期'.
   * Value: Extract the date and convert it to YYYY-MM-DD format.
4. payment_due_date:
   * Label: '自動轉賬' date.
   * Value: Look for the date associated with the autopay transaction and convert it to YYYY-MM-DD format. If not available, set to null.
II. Page 1 - Billing Summary (billing_summary object):
* previous_bill_amount:
   * Label: '前單總額' under '上月結餘'.
   * Value: The total amount from the previous bill.
* payment_received:
   * Label: '自動轉賬' under '上月結餘'.
   * Value: The amount marked with "CR". MUST be a negative number.
* balance_forwarded:
   * Label: '戶口結餘'.
   * Value: The balance after the payment was applied.
* total_amount_due:
   * Label: '本月收費總額'.
   * Value: The total amount due for the current billing period.
* current_charges:
   * Use the same value as total_amount_due. SmarTone bills often equate these two.
III. Service & Charge Details (service_details array):
CRITICAL: The details are broken down by mobile number across multiple pages. Iterate through each number's section.
For EACH mobile number block:
1. Create a new object in the service_details array and populate it:
   * service_number:
      * Label: '流動電話/服務 號碼'.
      * Value: Extract the 8-digit phone number.
   * subtotal:
      * Label: '項目總額'.
      * Value: The subtotal amount for that specific phone number.
   * charge_items (array):
      * Location: All line items listed under the service number.
      * For EACH line item, extract:
         * description: The Chinese text from the '項目內容' column.
         * period: The date or date range from the '日期' column. Convert to 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD' format. If blank, the value should be null.
         * amount: The numeric value from the '收費(HK$)' column. REMINDER: Convert values with "CR" to negative numbers.
IV. Final Validation Rule:
The sum of all subtotal fields from the service_details array should approximately equal the billing_summary.total_amount_due.
