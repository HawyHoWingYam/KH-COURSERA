# Clean S3 Path Structure Implementation - Test Results

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the user's suggested clean S3 path structure:
```
companies/{companyID}/prompts/{documentTypeID}/{configurationID}/filename
companies/{companyID}/schemas/{documentTypeID}/{configurationID}/filename
```

## ✅ Test Results

### Upload Tests
- **✅ Prompt Upload**: `test_invoice_prompt.txt` → `companies/7/prompts/43/40/test_invoice_prompt.txt`
- **✅ Schema Upload**: `test_invoice_schema.json` → `companies/7/schemas/43/40/test_invoice_schema.json`
- **✅ Database Update**: Original filenames correctly stored in database
- **✅ Clean Paths**: No temp prefixes in final S3 paths

### Download Tests
- **✅ Prompt Download**: Downloaded as `test_invoice_prompt.txt` (original filename preserved)
- **✅ Schema Download**: Downloaded as `test_invoice_schema.json` (original filename preserved)
- **✅ Content Integrity**: All content downloaded correctly
- **✅ Database Integration**: Original filenames retrieved from database first

### Database Verification
```sql
SELECT config_id, prompt_path, schema_path, original_prompt_filename, original_schema_filename 
FROM company_document_configs WHERE config_id = 40;
```

Results:
- `prompt_path`: `s3://hya-ocr-sandbox/companies/7/prompts/43/40/test_invoice_prompt.txt`
- `schema_path`: `s3://hya-ocr-sandbox/companies/7/schemas/43/40/test_invoice_schema.json`
- `original_prompt_filename`: `test_invoice_prompt.txt`
- `original_schema_filename`: `test_invoice_schema.json`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made:

1. **CompanyFileManager** (`utils/company_file_manager.py`):
   - Updated path structure from `{config_id}_{filename}` to `{config_id}/{filename}`
   - Clean directory structure with original filenames

2. **S3StorageManager** (`utils/s3_storage.py`):
   - Removed config prefixes from default filenames
   - Updated upload/download methods to use original filenames

3. **Upload Endpoint** (`app.py`):
   - Modified to use original filenames instead of path-based filenames
   - Enhanced database storage to include original filenames

4. **Download Endpoint** (`app.py`):
   - Priority-based download: database filename → clean path construction
   - Fixed string/bytes encoding issue
   - Original filename preservation in Content-Disposition header

### Benefits Achieved:

✅ **Predictable Paths**: Easy to construct paths programmatically
✅ **Original Filenames**: `invoice.txt` uploads as `invoice.txt`, downloads as `invoice.txt`
✅ **No Temp Prefixes**: Clean S3 structure without temporary identifiers
✅ **Simple Logic**: Direct path construction without complex fallbacks
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to debug and extend

## 🎉 Success Metrics Met

- [x] New configs: Upload "invoice.txt" → Download "invoice.txt" (exact match)
- [x] Clean S3 structure: `companies/7/prompts/43/40/test_invoice_prompt.txt`
- [x] Database consistency: Original filenames stored and retrieved correctly
- [x] No temp prefixes in downloaded filenames
- [x] Simplified codebase: Reduced complexity in upload/download logic

## 📋 Next Steps

- [ ] Create migration script for existing temp-prefixed files
- [ ] Test with various file types and edge cases
- [ ] Update documentation for the new path structure

## 🏆 Final Assessment

The implementation successfully addresses the user's original problem:
> "为什么我下载下来prompt 和 schema都和上传的不一样的?"

**Before**: Files uploaded as `invoice.txt` were downloaded as `temp_1758080821002_new_1758080820704_invoice_prompt.txt`

**After**: Files uploaded as `invoice.txt` are downloaded as `invoice.txt`

The clean S3 path structure provides a robust, maintainable solution that eliminates filename mismatches and provides predictable file organization.
