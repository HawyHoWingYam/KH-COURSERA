# .trivyignore - Trivy Security Scanner Ignore List
# 
# This file contains CVEs that have been reviewed and determined to be acceptable risks
# for this project. Each entry should include:
# - CVE ID
# - Brief explanation of why it's acceptable
# - Review date and reviewer
#
# Format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN [optional comment]
#
# IMPORTANT: Regularly review and update this list. 
# CVEs should only be ignored after proper risk assessment.

# =============================================================================
# BASE IMAGE CVEs - Common vulnerabilities in base images that are often 
# acceptable for development/testing environments
# =============================================================================

# Example entries (uncomment and modify as needed after proper risk assessment):
# CVE-2024-6387   # OpenSSH vulnerability - not used in containerized app
# CVE-2023-4911   # glibc vulnerability - patched in newer versions
# CVE-2023-29491  # ncurses vulnerability - not exposed in production

# =============================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT/TESTING ONLY CVEs
# =============================================================================

# CVEs that are acceptable in development but should be fixed for production
# These should be conditional based on environment tags

# =============================================================================
# LIBRARY-SPECIFIC IGNORES
# =============================================================================

# Python/Node.js specific vulnerabilities that don't apply to our use case
# (Add specific CVEs here after assessment)

# =============================================================================
# MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED
# =============================================================================

# When adding CVEs here:
# 1. Document the business justification
# 2. Include the date reviewed and by whom  
# 3. Set a review reminder date
# 4. Consider alternative mitigations

# Example format:
# CVE-2024-XXXXX  # [REVIEWED 2024-01-15 by Security Team] 
#                 # Risk: LOW - affects unused component
#                 # Mitigation: Component disabled in production config
#                 # Next review: 2024-07-15

# =============================================================================

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# - This file is checked into version control for transparency
# - All ignores should have documented business justification
# - Prefer fixing vulnerabilities over ignoring them
# - Use ignore-unfixed in Trivy config for issues without available fixes
# - Regularly audit this list during security reviews
