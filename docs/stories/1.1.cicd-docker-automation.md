# Story 1.1: CI/CD Docker Automation

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer and developer,
**I want** to implement a complete CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds Docker images on each development milestone and deploys them to production,
**so that** I can achieve seamless continuous delivery with consistent deployments across environments and enable Production environment to directly pull optimized Docker images.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers on push to main branch and release tags
2. Docker images are built with semantic versioning and pushed to Docker Hub (karash062/hya-ocr-sandbox)
3. Multi-stage Docker builds are optimized for production with minimal image size
4. Automated testing and security scanning are integrated into the CI pipeline
5. Production deployment can pull and deploy Docker images with zero downtime
6. Health checks and rollback mechanisms are implemented for failed deployments
7. Build artifacts include proper labeling with Git commit, build date, and version info
8. CI/CD pipeline supports both development and production deployment scenarios

- [x] Task 4: Enhance Deployment Automation (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [x] Update deploy.sh to support Docker Hub image pulling
  - [x] Implement versioned deployment with rollback capability
  - [x] Add production deployment verification steps

  - [x] Create troubleshooting guide

## Dev Notes

### CI/CD Architecture
Based on existing excellent Docker configuration, implementing GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Builds backend (Python FastAPI) and frontend (Next.js) images
- Uses existing Dockerfiles with optimizations
- Integrates with current deploy.sh zero-downtime deployment script
- Leverages existing production configuration (docker-compose.prod.yml)

### Docker Configuration
Current project has:
- Optimized backend.Dockerfile (Python 3.9-slim, non-root user, healthcheck)
- Optimized frontend.Dockerfile (Node 18-alpine, multi-stage build)
- Production docker-compose.prod.yml with AWS RDS/S3 integration
- Comprehensive deploy.sh with blue-green deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- Development: Auto-build on main branch push → `latest` tag
- Production: Manual release tags → semantic version tags (v1.0.0)
- Docker Hub repository: karash062/hya-ocr-sandbox
- Images: backend, frontend with consistent versioning

### Source Tree Reference
- GeminiOCR/backend.Dockerfile - Backend Docker configuration
- GeminiOCR/frontend.Dockerfile - Frontend Docker configuration  
- GeminiOCR/docker-compose.prod.yml - Production deployment config
- GeminiOCR/deploy.sh - Zero-downtime deployment script
- GeminiOCR/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md - Existing deployment documentation

### Testing
- Unit tests for backend API endpoints
- Frontend component testing
- Docker image security scanning
- Health check validations
- Integration testing with test database
